Acts 3:25-26

You are descendants of the prophets. You have received the agreement God made with your ancestors. He said to your father Abraham, 'Through your descendants all the nations on earth will be blessed.' God has raised up his servant Jesus and sent him to you first to bless you by turning each of you away from doing evil.
