Matthew 9:37    

He said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the workers are few."

## Diving Deeper into the Message

[John 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204&version=NIV){:target="_blank"}

The point of weekly worship is not **attendance**; it's **participation** in the body of Christ.

Being a follower of Jesus Christ is not about following rules or religious traditions. We surrender to God by dying to our sin and living in Jesus Christ so we may love all perfectly. An unconditional love is one only God can provide. By surrendering fully - mind, body, and soul - to God, we allow ourselves to accept his blessings in full. The harvest is great, and the hard work has already been done. It is our only calling to be God's humble servants. To deliver the Good News through his perfect love.
